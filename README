VaioBat 1.0 and VaioLCD 1.0 utilites for Sony Vaio
Copyright (C) 2002 Paul McAvoy <paulmcav@queda.net>

VaioBat 1.2: 	Support for two batteries enabled. Capacity percentage is
		always shown to have battery status while charging.


How to Install:

  make
  make install

The LCD module is derived from the code:
 vaiobright 1.1 by Mike Kernshaw <dragorn@nerv-un.net>.

The Battery / power module is based on code from the vaiobat.c file that came
with a 'picturebook' distrabution by Andrew Tridgel <tridge@linuxcare.com>

The original module I created was vaiobat.  Used to read and display battery
status information.  I realized that I needed a helper application similar
to the VaioBright module.  However, it seemed silly to me to have the
VaioBright module running with a helper app, and either add another helper
app, or customize his helper to support battery status info.

I ended up learing how to write a kernel module to serve the purpose of a
helper app to read info / set values for the Sony VAIO which I had.  As a
result, these two applications require that kernel module.
The archive can be found near the same location:

To install, you will need to firstly unpack the vaiostat archive.  Build and
install the kernel module.  Once the module is installed, information about
the Vaio will be avilable via a /proc filesystem entry (/proc/vaio/status)

This file is what both modules use to read / set information about it's state.

The original location for this package should be:
