VaioStat - Sony VAIO status / control kernel module.
====================================================

Installation Instructions:

  make
  make install (as root)

This kernel module once installed will generate a /proc file entry:

/proc/vaio/

Of which, there will be two more file entries.  The 'status' entry will
contain information about:
  lcd brightness (0-8)
  power supply sources (AT, BAT1, BAT2)
  power / time remaining (#/# #% #seconds H:M)

A value can be sent to the writable entry 'lcd' (0-8) to control the
brightness of the LCD panel.

I primarily set out to create this utility to find out how to write a basic
kernel module that would use the /proc file system.  So far it works pretty
well!
